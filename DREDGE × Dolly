Overview

DREDGE × Dolly is a lightweight lifting and release system designed to move insights gracefully through their full lifecycle:
	1.	Lift — heavy processing handled efficiently (GPU when available, CPU when not)
	2.	Preserve — encrypted, internal persistence using App Groups
	3.	Release — exportable to Files, printable to paper, shareable by design

Dolly does not decide.
DREDGE does not rush.
Together, they ensure nothing meaningful is dropped.

Core Philosophy
	•	Separation of roles
	•	DREDGE narrates, identifies, and remembers
	•	Dolly carries weight and returns results intact
	•	Apple-blessed paths only
	•	No private APIs
	•	No sandbox violations
	•	No brittle hacks
	•	One insight, many exits
	•	Internal storage
	•	User-owned files
	•	Physical print

Digital memory should be portable, durable, and human-reachable.

Included Components

SaveInsight.swift
Canonical internal storage using an App Group container.
This is the source of truth for persisted insights.

SaveToFiles.swift
Exports any saved insight using the system Share Sheet, allowing:
	•	Save to Files
	•	iCloud Drive
	•	AirDrop
	•	External storage

Ownership is transferred to the user—intentionally.

PrintInsight.swift
Enables AirPrint for any saved insight (TXT, PDF, RTF, rendered Markdown).
What was digital can become physical.

ArchiveAndRelease.swift
A single orchestration call:

Save → Files → Print

One action. Three guarantees.

Typical Flow

Design Intent

This system was built to support:
	•	Long-term personal knowledge archives
	•	Portable insight libraries
	•	Private, user-controlled memory
	•	Future expansion into on-device ML and vector recall

DREDGE remembers.
Dolly moves.
The human decides.
